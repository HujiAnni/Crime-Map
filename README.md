## How to Run
You can access this Project by clicking on this <a href="https://hujianni.github.io/Crime-Map/" target="_blank">link</a>. 
When the page is loaded, the map of New York City will appear on the screen. On top of the screen, you can navigate to view the crime reports either by a heatmap by clicking on "Heat Map", or by cluster by clicking on "Cluster Map". You can zoom in the map to get more detailed view of a certain Borough.
<ul>
<li>On the Heat Map, the area denser with red had the most crime records, while the blue area are moderate.</li>
<li>On the Cluster Map, when you zoom in to where each crime is represented by a small blue dot, you can click on the dot and a popup will show you more detailed description of the crime: which year, what crime, happened to whom (age group), the category of the crime, and whether the crime was successfully completed or attempted, but failed or was interrupted prematurely.</li>

<br>

## Future improvements
- [ ] Further improve the cluster to the category of the crime
- [ ] Try to get away with the 50k api limit
- [ ] Add more information about the crime to the popup
- [ ] Customize and simplify the fields when shown in the popup
